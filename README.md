## Web Pack
Web Pack is an open-source JavaScript module blunder. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform Front-end assets such as HTML, CSS & Images if the corresponding loaders are included. Web Pack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

## Motive
It will be helpful for new developer to work with Web Pack. In past ES6 was available in this repository. But now it is not available. Soon, ES6 will be available in Web Pack. Let me know if you want ES6.
