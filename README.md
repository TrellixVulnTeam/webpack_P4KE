### What is Web Pack
<p align="justify"> 
Web Pack is an open-source JavaScript module blunder. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. Web Pack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
